# Time Series üïê
- Every business operates under risk (based on market conditions) and uncertainty (due to some natural calamity)
- Forecasting helps us to assess these risks, and based on that the budgets can be managed.
- Time series involves analyzing data points collected to identify patterns and trends for predictions.

In simple times we can understand with the following equation:
```
y = f(x)
y: Dependent Variable (Future)
x: Independent Variable (Past)
```

### Properties of Time Series data.
- The data points (time intervals) should be at regular intervals.
- Intervals of Time Series: Yearly, Quarterly (4), Monthly(12), Weekly(52), Daily(365), Hourly
- Order matters in time series analysis, no data should be missing in the given time intervals.

<table>
  <tr><th colspan=3>Time Series</th></tr>
  <tr><th colspan=2>Systematic Component</th><th colspan=1>Irregular Component</th></tr>
  <tr><td>Trend</td><td>Seasonality</td><td>Unpredicted calamity (Error)</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Long term (Ups and downs)</td><td>Regular pattern</td><td>COVID pandemic or any uncertain natural calamity</td></tr>
</table>  

### Data Visualization
- Create plots (line charts, histograms, scatter plots) to identify trends, seasonality, and other patterns.

### Stationarity Check 
- A time series is stationary if its statistical properties (mean, median, variance, std, skewness, autocorrelation) remain constant over time.

### Decomposition of Time Series 
- Breaking of Time Series data into trend, seasonality and irregular components.
- We must find these three components in a given Time Series data.
 
### Decomposition Model
- There are two types of decomposition models.
- Additive model (seasonality is constant): Observation = Trend + Seasonality + Error
- Multiplicative model (seasonality is changing): Observation = Trend * Seasonality * Error

```
Forecasting Sales with Trend, Seasonality and Error:

Sales = Trend (Business Growth) + Seasonality (Weather) + Error (Theft / Calamity)
```

### Statsmodels 
- Python library that provides classes and functions for statistical tests on time series data.
